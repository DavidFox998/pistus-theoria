Towers / Attempts / T_g  (Batch 19.1c — Track 3)

**The two hard surfaces for the transfer operator `T_g`.**

Parked here as `sorry`-bearing stubs. NOT registered in BRICKS —
see `scripts/check-towers.sh`. Their presence does NOT promote
any tower; YM stays `Status: Open` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2) and
`MassGap_YM4_Clay` stays a schema.

  1. `Transfer_compact` — `T_g` is compact on `ℋ_phys`. **This is
     the mass gap for `g > 0`.** Cluster expansion / Glimm-Jaffe
     ch. 19 surface; no honest one-batch discharge.

  2. `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer` — the real bound
     `0 < g → spectral_radius_def D g < 1`. Requires the cluster
     expansion plus the Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive
     compact operators on the OS-reconstructed Hilbert space.

These sit alongside the three Batch 18 stubs (`Perron.lean`,
`UniformGap.lean`, `Enstrophy.lean`) — same discipline, same
no-auto-promotion guarantee.

/-- **`T_g` is compact on `ℋ_phys`.** Cluster-expansion surface;
the named witness here is the still-NAMED `physHilbert_isHilbert`
Prop, used as a Prop-level stand-in for "the construction has
produced a real compact operator on a real Hilbert space". The
proof is left as `sorry`.

**Batch 19.1d / 19.1e / 19.1f note:** the cluster-expansion
*skeleton* now lives in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean`
(35 bricks: 8 from 19.1d + 12 from 19.1e + 15 from 19.1f, the
last batch landing the real Kotecky-Preiss strict criterion
`Kotecky_Preiss_real : K * Δ < 1` and the strict-contraction
bridge `Strict_contraction_CE : g < g₀ → r(T_g) ≤
Decay_constant_from_KP`). Discharging this sorry is the
Arzelà-Ascoli argument applied to `Transfer_from_measure`
together with `Strict_contraction_CE` lifted to its strict
form (the `≤ → <` gap is parked in
`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean :: Strict_contraction_CE_real`).
The real discharge needs (a) a real Wilson measure, (b) the
Brydges-Federbush convergent polymer expansion at the full
textbook `K * e * Δ < 1` (19.1f ships the `e = 1` slice),
(c) a real operator-norm on `physHilbert`. -/

/-- **Real Perron–Frobenius bound: `r(T_g) < 1` for `g > 0`.**

Honest scope: with the current placeholder `spectral_radius_def := 1`,
this statement is **false on its face** (`(1 : ℝ) < 1` is `False`).
That mismatch is intentional — it is the tripwire telling the next
batch that promoting `spectral_radius_def` away from the literal
`1` placeholder will require landing the real cluster-expansion
bound here. Marked `sorry`; lives outside BRICKS so the axiom
footprint of the green wall is untouched.

**Batch 19.1d / 19.1e / 19.1f note:** the cluster-expansion
skeleton ships in `Towers/YM/ClusterExpansion.lean` (35 bricks).
Three named bridges now land the explicit reduction:
`Transfer_bound_from_CE` reduces `r(T_g) < 1` to the Prop
`spectral_radius_def D g < 1` (19.1d); `Transfer_contraction_from_CE`
ships the K=1 trivial slice `g < g₀ → r(T_g) ≤ 1` (19.1e); and
`Spectral_radius_lt_one` is the 19.1f named-handle bridge
`g < g₀ → (r < 1) → (r < 1)`. The 19.1f
`MassGap_from_spectral_radius` then composes with
`Perron_Frobenius_statement` to give `0 < mass_gap_def`. Real
discharge = Brydges-Federbush convergent polymer expansion at
the full `K * e * Δ < 1` (the 19.1f `Kotecky_Preiss_real`
ships only the `e = 1`, `Δ = 0` slice). The companion stub
`Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean ::
Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real` carries the same `sorry` as a
ClusterExpansion-shaped surface; this T_g surface stays as the
canonical "Perron-Frobenius for the transfer operator" sorry. -/
